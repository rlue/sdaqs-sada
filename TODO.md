* Add country to search results / popups
* Show more feedback on map when hovering over comboboxes
  (toggle popups??)
* Make markers clickable
  (Currently, this is half-implemented via 8f3e22d,
  setting popups on markers instead of directly on the map.)
* A11y: how to keyboard-navigate date selection?
* Add 404 page
